Basic Syntax and Data Types
Control Structures (if, for, while)
Functions and Modules
Data Structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
File Handling
Error Handling and Exceptions
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Advanced Topics (decorators, generators, context managers)
Libraries and Frameworks (e.g., NumPy, pandas, Flask, Django)
